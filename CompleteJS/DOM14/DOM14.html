<!-- // 👉 The DOM is the Document Object Model, which deals with the document, 
// the HTML elements themselves, e.g. document and all traversal you 
// would do in it, events, etc.

// For Ex: 👨‍🏫
// change the background color to red
// document.body.style.background = "red";


// 👉 The BOM is the Browser Object Model, which deals with browser components 
// aside from the document, like history, location, navigator and screen 
// (as well as some others that vary by browser). OR 
// In simple meaning all the Window operations which comes under BOM are performed 
// usign BOM  -->
